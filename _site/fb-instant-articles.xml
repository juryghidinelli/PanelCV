      Questo blog raccoglie gli articoli che talvolta mi diletto a scrivere per mettere &quot;nero su bianco&quot; alcune riflessioni, esperienze di lavoro, cose interssanti.

                    <p>For a couple of years I have been using this blog to post
snippets about new projects in the <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects">Little Electronics &amp; Arduino Projects (LEAP)</a> GitHub repo.</p>

<p>This was mainly a way to have a project link I could use as link bait;-) …
but it was also a chore I could do without!</p>

<p>A little while back I revised the Jekyll static web site generator that runs over the
<a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects">LEAP repo</a>
and is responsible for
for its accompanying site at <a href="https://leap.tardate.com">leap.tardate.com</a>.</p>

<p>Now the LEAP site renders each project nicely for the web, with social sharing support i.e. with twitter card, open graph etc.
It also has an <a href="https://leap.tardate.com/catalog/atom.xml">RSS feed</a> of all the projects as they are added.
To dig under the cover of how this works, see notes in the <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/catalog">/catalog</a> folder of the repo.</p>

<p>So in future, I’ll probably only post about LEAP projects on this blog if they are really really special in some way.
And if you just want to follow the electronics stuff - follow <a href="https://leap.tardate.com">leap.tardate.com</a> instead of this blog!</p>

                    <p><strong>Mr BiJuT</strong> is what I’m calling my freeform realisation of a simple NPN/PNP transistor testing circuit.</p>

<p>This is a nifty little design that I found in the
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3415601-radio-and-electronics-cookbook">Radio and Electronics Cookbook</a>.
It is one of those circuits that is the height of simplicity but is also quite tricky in it’s own way!
Whether you immediately “get” how it works depends very much on how you draw the schematic;-)</p>

<p>As always, <a href="https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/BJT/MrBiJuT">all notes, schematics and code are in the Little Electronics &amp; Arduino Projects repo on GitHub</a></p>

                    <p>I remember lusting after an Ibanez Tube Screamer back in the day - they really were the stuff of legend.
The most famous is perhaps the TS-808. After researching the original circuit and examining how it works in detail.
I decided to build one with only a few modifications to the original circuit.
I’m calling it The Goblin, owing to the custom stippled-green paint job I gave the 1590B enclosure.</p>

<p>I’m really impressed with the sound it produces. Here’s a quick soundcheck and smoke test:</p>
